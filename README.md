# Capstone-Project-V---NLP
# Compulsory Task 1
● In a file called nlp_1.txt, categorise which type of NLP application applies for
each of the following use-cases:
(Use the categories we have discussed on this bootcamp so far)
a. A model that allocates which mail folder an email should be sent to
(work, friends, promotions, important), like Gmail’s inbox tabs.
b. A model that helps decide what grade to award to an essay question.
This can be used by a university professor who grades a lot of classes
or essay competitions.
c. A model that provides assistive technology for doctors to provide
their diagnosis. Remember, doctors ask questions, so the model will
use the patients’ answers to provide a probable diagnosis for the
doctor to weigh and make decisions

# Compulsory Task 2
● Think about your environment — school, work, or home — and think of a
problem you face that can be solved by Natural Language Processing. Be as
descriptive as possible and show what value it will add to the environment
in question.
For example, if you are a stand-up comedian, you can come up with a
model that analyses the topics and areas your audience responds to the
most. This can be done by, say, identifying tweets (or Facebook posts) that
have the most ‘retweets’ (or ‘likes’). The tweets or posts will then be
categorised into topics and if you want to create a new comic routine, you
can stick to the topics mined using your followers’ reactions! So, think of a
scenario that applies to your life/work/school and how you can apply NLP to
your environment, and save your answer in a file called nlp_2.txt.

# Compulsory Task 3
● Read up on any innovative technology using NLP (by companies such as
Google or IBM, for instance) and write a brief summary about the
technology, what it achieves/does, and an overview of how it works.
To take an example, you may have noticed Gmail’s auto-response
suggestions on your incoming emails. If I send an email to your Gmail
address asking for an appointment, on opening the mail you would notice
Gmail’s automatically suggested response options such as “Yes, that works
for me” and “Sorry, I’m not available at that time.”
● Save your answer in a file called nlp_3.txt.
