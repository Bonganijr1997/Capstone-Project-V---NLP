For a model that allocates which mail folder an email should be sent to, you can use a text classification model.
The model can be trained on labeled data where each email is associated with the correct folder (work, friends, promotions, important). 
You can use natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to build this classification model.
Once trained, the model can predict the appropriate folder for a new email based on its content.
